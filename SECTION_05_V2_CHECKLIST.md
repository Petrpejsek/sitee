## 🎯 Success Criteria (User Test)

Ask a non-technical person (restaurant owner, lawyer, plumber):

1. **Can they explain what Section 05 offers?**
   - Expected: "They build a website that makes AI recommend you"

2. **Can they name the 3 benefits?**
   - Expected: At least 1-2 (magnet, better leads, or growth)

3. **Can they see the difference vs agencies?**
   - Expected: "This is faster/systematic, agencies are slow"

4. **Can they pick a package?**
   - Expected: "I'd pick the 30-page one" (or explain why)

If YES to 3/4 → **SUCCESS** ✅
