# Section 05 v2: Sales Implementation — Complete

**Date:** December 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete

---

## 🎯 Transformation Summary

Section 05 has been completely redesigned from a generic "packages selector" into a **high-conversion sales block** with clear value proposition, comparison, and real package tiers.

---

## 📐 New Layout Structure

Section 05 is now divided into **4 distinct parts**:

### Part 1: Hero Offer (ONE CORE SERVICE)
**Purpose:** Establish the core value proposition with magnet framing

**Elements:**
- **Headline:** "Turn Your Website Into a Customer Magnet for the AI Era"
- **Subheadline:** Clear explanation of GEO + LLM system
- **3 Main Benefits:**
  1. 🧲 Customer Magnet (AI-driven demand)
  2. 🎯 Higher-Intent Leads (less junk, more buyers)
  3. 📈 Compounding Advantage (future-proof growth)
- **Deliverables (Turnkey):**
  - Website strategy + page map (built from audit gaps)
  - Service pages (scope, boundaries, "who it's for / not for")
  - Pricing & packages (structured + comparable)
  - Proof system (case studies / testimonials)
  - Comparison & alternatives pages
  - FAQ / objections (AI-quotable)
  - GEO/entity structure
  - Launch-ready delivery
- **Audit Connection:** Subtle reference to gaps found in sections 03-04

---

### Part 2: Market Proof Strip
**Purpose:** Provide market context without fake numbers

**Elements:**
- **Statement:** "AI search & recommendation is becoming a primary decision channel"
- **3 Key Points:**
  - Businesses that become citeable sources win more high-intent traffic
  - Market is expanding fast
  - We build you the structure to capture it
- **3 Placeholder Stats:** (clearly marked as placeholders)
  - `[STAT PLACEHOLDER #1]` — Growth in AI-assisted search
  - `[STAT PLACEHOLDER #2]` — Lead quality from high-intent channels
  - `[STAT PLACEHOLDER #3]` — Time/cost vs traditional agencies

**Note:** All stats labeled as "Sources: Industry trend data" with placeholder formatting

---

### Part 3: Comparison Block (Traditional vs sitee.ai)
**Purpose:** Position sitee.ai as systemized alternative to slow agencies

**Layout:** 2 columns side-by-side

#### LEFT: Agencies / Freelancers / Marketing Companies
- Slow delivery (weeks or months)
- Too many meetings + revisions
- Generic templates not built for LLM decision logic
- Content not mapped to AI recommendation requirements
- Manual updates (expensive)
- Unclear ownership of the system

#### RIGHT: sitee.ai — AI Recommendation Website System
- ✓ Systemized build (faster delivery)
- ✓ Built directly from your audit gaps (sections 03 + 04)
- ✓ Decision-level structure (pricing, comparisons, proof, FAQs)
- ✓ GEO + entity-ready architecture
- ✓ Consistent updates & improvements (system approach)
- ✓ Turnkey: plan → build → launch

**Tone:** Comparison of categories, not aggressive attack. Fair but clear positioning.

---

## 🎨 Color System (Updated)

**New Premium Color Palette:**

Primary Action (Green):
--emerald-600: #059669   → CTAs, recommended badge, checkmarks
--emerald-700: #047857   → Hover states
--emerald-50:  #ecfdf5   → Light backgrounds

Neutral/Premium:
--gray-900:  #111827   → Headings
--gray-800:  #1f2937   → Body text (strong)
--gray-700:  #374151   → Body text (normal)
--gray-600:  #4b5563   → Secondary text
--gray-500:  #6b7280   → Tertiary text
--gray-300:  #d1d5db   → Borders

**Removed:**

**Philosophy:**
- Section 05 = calm, premium, confident
- Green = action, growth, positive
- White space = premium positioning
- High contrast text = readability

## 📝 Copy Guidelines

### Headlines (Rules)
1. **Must be benefit-driven**, not feature-driven
2. **Avoid "we offer" language** → Use "Turn X into Y" framing
3. **AI Era positioning** → Make it about the future, not the past

### Subheadlines (Rules)
1. **Technical detail** → What we actually do (GEO + LLM)
2. **Clear outcome** → "so when customers ask AI..."
3. **No fluff** → Every word must work

### Benefits (Rules)
1. **Name it** → Give each benefit a memorable name
2. **Subtitle it** → Add a category label
3. **Explain outcome** → What customer gets, not what we do

### Deliverables (Rules)
1. **"We deliver X"** → Not "we improve" or "we optimize"
2. **Concrete artifacts** → Service pages, pricing pages, FAQ
3. **Connect to audit** → Reference section 03/04 gaps

### Comparison (Rules)
1. **Fair but clear** → Don't trash competitors
2. **Category comparison** → Agencies vs system
3. **Systemic differences** → Speed, structure, approach

### Packages (Rules)
1. **Real numbers** → Page count must be visible
2. **Incremental value** → Each tier builds on previous
3. **Clear CTA** → Action verb + tier name
